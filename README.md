# Capstone Project
MovieLens Recommendation Systems for Berkeley ML/AI course

## Problem Statement 
Can we build an accurate and scalable movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences, past ratings, and movie features, while comparing different classification approaches for improved prediction accuracy?


## Model Outcomes or Predictions: 
Identify the type of learning (classification or regression) and specify the expected output of your selected model. Determine whether supervised or unsupervised learning algorithms will be used.

## Data Acquisition
We will be demonstrating a variety of movie recommendation systems for the (MovieLens 1M dataset)[https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/]. The dataset contain 1,000,209 anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies made by 6,040 MovieLens users who joined MovieLens in 2000.


## Data Preprocessing/Preparation: 
For this deliverable, you are tasked with detailing how you cleaned the data for your notebook. 
What techniques did you use to ensure your data was free of missing values, and inconsistencies? 
How did you split the data into training and test sets?
Please include any necessary analysis and encoding steps you took as well.

## Modeling: 
For this deliverable, please document your selection of machine learning algorithms that you selected for your problem statement from the first deliverable.

## Model Evaluation: 
Share your model evaluation here. What types of models did you consider for your problem (classification, regression, unsupervised)?  Articulate the evaluation metrics you used and how you determined which model was most optimal for your problem.
